[01:59:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Any reason why?
[01:59:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> more compact
[01:59:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> I'm not sure though
[01:59:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> than #3?
[02:00:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> yeah. 3 you need a large base as well as hoppers can't feed the items into the elevator
[02:00:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> the point of this mine is that there will be hoppers down the middle so you can just drop your items
[02:00:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> in the hoppers and then they run to the elevator and go up
[02:01:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Ok, I've gotcha
[02:01:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> I actuall have most of the materials for #2
[02:01:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> just need to make a bunch of droppers
[02:01:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> I hope they don't need bows lmao
[02:01:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Even the comparaters?
[02:02:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> yeah I have like a stack or more I think
[02:02:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> unless they got used :P
[02:02:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> yeah I have 60 already
[02:02:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> might need a few more
[02:03:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Want me to make droppers?
[02:03:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> sure
[02:03:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> I think we need like 50
[02:05:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Got em
[02:05:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> nice
[02:05:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> just digging out the room we will pump the items into
[02:06:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> hmm
[02:06:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> which side to build it on
[02:06:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> i think the north side
[02:06:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> The side with the stoves
[02:06:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> yeha
[02:06:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> that is north I'm pretty sure
[02:06:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> hehe
[02:07:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> yeah
[02:08:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> mmk here we go lol
[02:08:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> gunna put iron bars on the sides :D
[02:08:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Ok
[02:09:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> I can't picture, so I'll take your word for it :P
[02:09:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> haha ok
[02:13:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> OWWW
[02:13:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> LOL
[02:13:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> ?
[02:13:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> I almost died falling
[02:13:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Ouch :P
[02:14:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> oo lapis
[02:15:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> nice, ready to build
[02:16:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Sorry, repairing picks :P
[02:16:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> hehe np
[02:18:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> mmkay
[02:18:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> yeah
[02:18:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> this way is best
[02:19:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Want me to start up?
[02:19:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> hmm
[02:19:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> maybe I should move it back one block
[02:19:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> to give the water a bit of room
[02:19:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> mmk so that can go right up to the storage level
[02:21:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Want me to make the iron bars?
[02:21:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> lemme see how this works first
[02:21:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> I think bars would be cool though
[02:21:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> not sure if we have the iron for it yet though
[02:21:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> yep yep
[02:22:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> I need iron for hoppers so lets wait haha
[02:22:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> decoration can come later :P
[02:22:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> yay it works
[02:23:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> im so gunna die building this LOL
[02:23:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> hehe
[02:23:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Want me to go up one side?
[02:23:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> sure
[02:24:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> is that right?
[02:24:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Looks right
[02:24:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> nice
[02:24:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> yeah it is faster to do one side at a time haha
[02:26:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> nice
[02:26:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> round 2 lol
[02:26:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> ry
[02:27:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> ty*
[02:27:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> hehe
[02:30:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> is it working?
[02:30:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Sent one up
[02:31:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> yes~
[02:31:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> hehe
[02:31:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> nice
[02:31:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> hehe
[02:32:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Chick!
[02:32:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> CHeck
[02:33:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> rather
[02:33:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> seems to be stuck somewhere?
[02:33:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Good greef, I need a new keyboard
[02:33:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> haha
[02:33:45] [Server thread/INFO]: iamnbutler fell from a high place
[02:33:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> LOL
[02:33:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Oh yuck :P
[02:34:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> it seems to hang after grabbing like 10 or so items
[02:34:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> not sure why
[02:34:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> wonder if it is the wall
[02:34:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> behind the elevator
[02:36:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Here
[02:37:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Fixed :)
[02:37:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> oh? what was wrong?
[02:37:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Too many items in the hopper at once; that's what the hopper's for
[02:37:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> ahh
[02:37:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> ic
[02:38:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> nice
[02:38:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> working now
[02:39:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Cool!
[02:42:05] [Server thread/INFO]: Tarnanduil fell from a high place
[02:42:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> uh oh LOL
[02:42:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> guess... we better make the pool wider
[02:42:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> ahaha
[02:42:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> lemme knwo if u are missing anyhting
[02:42:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> might have picked some up
[02:43:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> two redstone torches
[02:44:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Oh thanks :)
[02:44:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> np have like two stacks lol
[02:44:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Nice :)
[02:44:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> ok perfect
[02:44:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> now we can load the hopper from the top
[02:45:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> now I just need 48375209438752 hoppers
[02:48:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> nice
[02:48:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> got this started
[02:49:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> now time to make more hoppers T T
[02:49:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> I think I played with something I shouldn't have :S
[02:49:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> hahaha
[02:49:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> we can work out the storage later
[02:53:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> hehe
[02:53:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> all hidden
[02:54:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> there they go~
[02:55:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Fixed it :P
[02:55:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> mmk
[02:55:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> that is pretty good for now
[02:55:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> decoration will come later
[02:55:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> but it is functional now
[02:57:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> idk if you noticed but this side is the wrong width...
[02:57:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> I did...
[02:57:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> yeah
[02:57:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> i'm gunna fix it
[02:57:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> lol
[02:57:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> I decided not to say anything :P
[02:57:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> it's gunna be a lot of work ahaha
[02:57:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> yeah I noticed the day after I finished it
[02:57:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> LOL
[02:58:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> once I dug out the next side
[02:58:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> It's because of the creeper head :S
[02:58:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> I'm gunna mirror everything to the east side
[02:58:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> then I can dig out the extra block
[02:58:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> so the bulk storage will be the east side
[02:58:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Ah
[02:58:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> unless we should put it on the north side
[02:58:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> idk if we are gunna build a sorting system or now
[02:59:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> *not
[02:59:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> So everything will look like the East side?
[02:59:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> this south side is right
[02:59:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> and this side is right
[02:59:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> for the double chest type
[02:59:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> so there will be 2 wings with double chests, and two with single
[02:59:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Ah
[03:00:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> but I wonder if I shold put bulk storage in the north side
[03:00:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> since the item elevator is right under this
[03:00:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Sure
[03:01:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> we actually only used 19 comparitors
[03:01:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> not bad
[03:02:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Oh, that's not bad :P
[03:02:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> I'll work out a better way to get up later
[03:02:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> kk
[03:02:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> might make a minecart elevator or just wait for slime elevators
[03:04:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> hehe gunna do a bit of the first strip then go afk the iron farm and sleep
[03:04:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> getting tired
[03:04:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> gotcha
[03:04:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> headed to bed soon
[03:05:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> oo lava already haha
[03:05:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Nice :P
[03:08:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> ok, I'm off; Got a LOT done :P
[03:08:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> hehe yeah
[03:08:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> have a good one
[03:08:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> thanks for the help :D
[03:08:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> See ya soon; you too! Of course! :D
[03:08:35] [Server thread/INFO]: Tarnanduil lost connection: TextComponent{text='Disconnected', siblings=[], style=Style{hasParent=false, color=null, bold=null, italic=null, underlined=null, obfuscated=null, clickEvent=null, hoverEvent=null}}
[03:08:35] [Server thread/INFO]: Tarnanduil left the game
[03:28:17] [Server thread/INFO]: iamnbutler fell from a high place
