[00:48:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Woot!
[00:48:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> hai :o
[00:48:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> noticed you have been busy
[00:49:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Indeed!
[00:49:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Krigy and I have been busy bees :)
[00:49:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> haha
[00:49:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> not sure if you noticed but I set up a portal system linking from the main town
[00:49:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> it goes to various places
[00:50:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> the stronghold that goes to the end, and a bunch of other places
[00:50:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> I tried one and I think it malfunctioned :P
[00:50:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> o.O where did you end up?
[00:50:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> it should work
[00:51:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> I think a lower level in the nether; it was one of the portals in the nether
[00:51:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> ohh.. marshall must have left the lower one active
[00:51:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> it isn't supposed to be active lol
[00:51:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Ended up running back :P
[00:52:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> lemme go fix that
[00:52:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Had plenty of food, so it was fine :)
[00:52:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> o ya
[00:52:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> I have a fortune pick if you need any rare materials farmed
[00:53:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Diamonds are just waiting to be mined :)
[00:53:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> ok so where didja get stuck in the portal room?
[00:54:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> It was down the incomplete tunnel
[00:54:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> ph
[00:54:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> oh
[00:54:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> marshall added a bunch
[00:54:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> the only one you should really need is the one that is straight
[00:55:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> when you come out the portal
[00:55:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> then turn left
[00:55:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> takes you to the stronghold and the end where the enderman spawner is
[00:55:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> went through the first time fine, came back fine; then I think it added another one, and I got stuck
[00:55:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> Alrighty
[00:55:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Tarnanduil> sounds good
[00:55:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> I'll label all the paths once I get back to working on it
[00:55:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> ahh I see
[00:55:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <iamnbutler> that can happen if the portal isn't placed properly
